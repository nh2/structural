It ought to be possible to define a DSL or simple framework upon which
to build a structural editor for a given language.

* Nodes.
* Optional nodes.
* Lists of notes, separated by some thing.
* Text input boxes.

These, probably with a couple other things, should be sufficient to
define a fairly complete editor for a language.

I made a very simple incomplete one just to demo the idea, in the
haskell/ directory.

The concept should be suited to web, or Emacs, or Vim, or whatever
editor has strong enough extensibility.

I strongly encourage anyone reading this to re-implement completely
the web idea, or do it in Emacs, etc. The demo implementation I put in
haskell/ is just that, a demo. See video here:
